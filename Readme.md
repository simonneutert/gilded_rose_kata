# Refactor like a Boss!

Sandi's inspiring talk at [RailsConf 2014 - All the Little Things by Sandi Metz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bZh5LMaSmE) is the reason why this repository exists.

I wanted to understand, so I rewrote code from her talk and reverse engineered most of the tests you will see here. So, there is a chance, that the genuine code of the talk is already out there somewhere and I just didn't find it ðŸ˜“ Nevertheless writing this down has taught me a lot.

I propose you watch her [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bZh5LMaSmE) and then come back to this repository and see for yourself - step by step.

__It is time to learn how to refactor and keep your sanity!__ :wink:

#### What you will learn:

* test-driven development (for absolute beginners)
* what an Object Factory can look like
* How Inheritance works


## How to work with this code

All steps Sandi takes saved and ordered in directories of this repository.

The code is sprinkled with comments along the way.

Fire up your terminal, clone the repository, `cd` into one of the directories and run the tests yourself:

`$ ruby -Itest gilded_rose_test.rb`
